# A Personal, Organic AI Framework That Grows and Learns With You

- Atulya is not a predefined AI framework. It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it.
- Fully transparent, readable, comprehensible, customizable, and interactive.
- Uses the computer as a tool to accomplish its (your) tasks.

---

# Key Features

## 1. General-purpose Assistant

- Atulya is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other Atulya instances, and do its best to accomplish it.
- Persistent memory allows it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.

## 2. Computer as a Tool

- Atulya uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.
- **Default Tools:** Includes knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.
- **Creating Custom Tools:** Extend functionality by creating your own custom tools.
- **Instruments:** A new type of tool that allows you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Atulya Zero.

## 3. Multi-Atulya Cooperation

- Every Atulya has a superior Atulya giving it tasks and instructions. Every Atulya then reports back to its superior.
- The first Atulya in the chain (Atulya 0) interacts directly with the human user.
- Subordinate Atulyas help break down and solve subtasks, keeping context clean and focused.

## 4. Completely Customizable and Extensible

- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.
- The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the **prompts/default/atulya.system.md** file. Change this prompt to dramatically alter the framework.
- Every prompt, message template, and default tool can be found in the **prompts/** and **python/tools/** folders for customization.

## 5. Communication is Key

- Proper system prompts and instructions enable Atulya to perform complex tasks.
- Atulyas communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance.
- The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive, allowing users to intervene at any point.

# üõ†Ô∏è Atulya Zero API

Atulya Zero now includes a powerful API, available in the `atulya_api` module. This API enables programmatic access to Atulya's core features, making it easy to integrate Atulya Zero into your own applications, scripts, or services.

## Key Features
- **RESTful Endpoints:** Interact with Atulya Zero using standard HTTP methods.
- **Task Automation:** Submit tasks, retrieve results, and manage sessions programmatically.
- **Extensible:** Easily add custom endpoints or extend existing functionality.
- **Django-based:** Built on Django for reliability and scalability.

## Getting Started
- The API code is located in the `atulya_api/` directory.
- To run the API server:
  ```bash
  cd atulya_api
  python run.py
  ```
- Default settings and configuration can be found in `atulya_api/config/settings.py`.

## API Documentation
- Interactive API docs are available at `/docs` when the server is running.
- See [docs/api_documentation.md](./docs/api_documentation.md) for detailed endpoint descriptions and usage examples.

## Example Use Cases
- Integrate Atulya Zero with external tools or web services.
- Automate workflows by sending tasks to Atulya via HTTP requests.
- Build custom user interfaces or chatbots powered by Atulya's intelligence.

# üëÄ Keep in Mind

## 1. Atulya Zero Can Be Dangerous!

- With proper instruction, Atulya Zero is capable of many things, even potentially dangerous actions concerning your computer, data, or accounts. Always run Atulya Zero in an isolated environment (like Docker) and be careful what you wish for.

## 2. Atulya Zero Is Prompt-based.

- The whole framework is guided by the **prompts/** folder. Atulya guidelines, tool instructions, messages, utility AI functions, it's all there.
